### A service for handling you in-office foosball needs
Does your office have a foosball table? Do you employ software developers?
Then they have no doubt discussed coming up with a rating system for their matches to see how they stack up against each other.
This service will save their development time for more pressing features with actual deadlines.

This repository has a complete backend and REST API for logging matches and calculating rating, leaderboards and player stats.
All you have to do is deploy it, play foosball and log the results. 

**Notice:** Your developers might instead start thinking about creating a frontend for this service to thow onto a screen near the table.
